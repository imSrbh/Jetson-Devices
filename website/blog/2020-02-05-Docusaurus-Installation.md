[__Docusaurus__](https://docusaurus.io/en)

Docusaurus is a tool designed to make it easy for teams to publish documentation websites without having to worry about the infrastructure and design details. At its core, all a user has to provide are documentation files written in markdown, customization of a provided home page written in React, and a few configuration modifications.

___
**Installation**

This tutorial is geared at first-time users who want detailed instructions on how to go from zero to a Docusaurus website that has versions. Let&#39;s start!
___
**Install Git**

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development and it can help you synchronize and version files between your local system and your online repository. Git for Windows includes Git Bash, a terminal application. If not already installed, see [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

```console
$sudo apt install git-all

$git --version
```
___
**Install Node.js**

Node.js is an environment that can run JavaScript code outside of a web browser and is used to write and run server-side JavaScript apps. Node.js installation includes npm, the package manager that allows you to install NPM modules from your terminal.

```console
$sudo apt update

$sudo apt install nodejs

$sudo apt install npm

$nodejs -v
```

___
**Or Install Yarn (Optional)**

We highly recommend that you install Yarn, an alternative package manager that has superb performance for managing your NPM dependencies. Check it out [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

___
**Create a GitHub repository and local clone**

___
__In Terminal:__

```console
smc-vm@ubuntu:~$ mkdir doc\_projects

smc-vm@ubuntu:~$ cd doc\_projects/
```

Clone your repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/imSrbh/docusaurus-tutorial.git

___
**Install the Docusaurus init command**

Docusaurus comes with a command line tool to help you scaffold a Docusaurus site with some example templates. Let&#39;s install the installer!

Run the following command:

npm install --global docusaurus-init


___
>**Create new Site**

___
**Scaffold the Site**

cd to the directory of your local repository.
```console
$cd docusaurus-tutorial
```
Execute the docusaurus-init command in your terminal.
```console
$docusaurus-init
```

>The Linking dependencies... step might take a while, but it will finish eventually.

The following contents will be created in your current directory. Some example documentation pages (under docs) and blog posts (under website/blog) are included.

Run cd website to go into the website directory.

Run npm start or yarn start.

A browser window will open up at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

Congratulations, you have just made your first Docusaurus site! Click around the pages to get a feel for it.

**Directory Structure**

As shown after you [installed Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation), the initialization script created a directory structure similar to:

![](https://github.com/imSrbh/Jetson-Devices/blob/master/website/static/img/dir2.png?raw=true)

**Directory Descriptions**

- Documentation Source Files: The docs directory contains example documentation files written in Markdown.
- Blog: The website/blog directory contains examples of blog posts written in markdown.
- Pages: The website/pages directory contains example top-level pages for the site.
- Static files and images: The website/static directory contains static assets used by the example site.

**Key Files**

- Footer: The website/core/Footer.js file is a React component that acts as the footer for the site generated by Docusaurus and should be customized by the user.
- Configuration file: The website/siteConfig.js file is the main configuration file used by Docusaurus.
- Sidebars: The json file contains the structure and order of the documentation files.
- .gitignore: The .gitignore file lists the necessary ignore files for the generated site so that they do not get added to the git repo.

**Preparation Notes**

You will need to keep the website/siteConfig.js and website/core/Footer.js files but may edit them as you wish. The value of the customDocsPath key in website/siteConfig.js can be modified if you wish to use a different directory name or path. The website directory can also be renamed to anything you want it to be.

However, you should keep the website/pages and website/static directories. You may change the content inside them as you wish. At the bare minimum, you should have an en/index.js or en/index.html file inside website/pages and an image to use as your header icon inside website/static.

If your directory does not yet have a .gitignore, we generate it with the necessary ignored files listed. As a general rule, you should ignore all node\_modules, build files, system files (.DS\_Store), logs, etc. [Here](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore) is a more comprehensive list of what is normally ignored for Node.js projects.
